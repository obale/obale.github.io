	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In order to be ready for the challenges as entrepreneur I try to learn as much as possible from
different sources. One, very useful, source was, and is, the uprise and most time also downfall of other
startups. One important thing that I have learned is that
a startup is all about the people. With the right people you get the right know-how and the right
environment to overcome the biggest challenges.</p>

<p>If you have not the right people for the right job you will fail. <em>Right</em> is more about attitude
as about academic skills. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, academic skills are a must, but everybody in your
team should be able to get them on the go. As described in previous posts you have to extend your skills
outside your field of expertise. It helps if you have a heterogeneous team that is able to exchange
knowledge. Develop your expertise the same way as you would develop software in an agile way. The following
steps are a simplified way how such a process for knowledge exchange can look like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define a challenge that you want solve, e.g. with a clear problem statement</li>
<li>Learn as much as possible about this topic.</li>
<li>Listen and discuss with people around you, maybe you have an expert in your team or you can get feedback
from somebody outside.</li>
<li>Evaluate all knowledge that (you think) you have about this topic.</li>
<li>If your knowledge is sufficient to solve the challenge you are good, otherwise get back to
point 3.</li>
</ol>


<p>As you can see you extend your skills in an iterative way. The most important, but also hardest part
is point 4. Nobody likes to admit that he or she is wrong or that the own knowledge is not accurate or
incomplete. But without acknowledging your failures you are not able to learn, at least not so fast as you
could. To be honest I am not as good as I should with this point, but I try to get better each day.</p>

<p>Now we know how we can improve our skills via knowledge exchange. This makes us to an important
member of our team. But what is about the right attitude? My personal feeling is that the right attitude is
crucial to survive, at least for a young startup. It is the breeding ground for innovation. Do you really
want to be part of an startup? The right answer should be YES, at least for a few years. You should not miss this
opportunity.</p>

<p>It can be a roller coaster ride, with a lot of downs and ups, especially if you have to motivate yourself each single day&hellip;
But it is definitely worth it. You invest a few years of your life to learn and improve your skills and not to forget your
personality&hellip; hopefully to something better. Dependent on your goals you have maybe also a positive impact on your society.
We all are getting older each day and our priorities change. This is also the
reason why I have decided to take the chance to be an entrepreneur now and for the next few years. Independent if it succeeds
or fails I will shift for sure to a more stable life in a later point in time, but I definitely don&rsquo;t want to miss the
possibility to be an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Please let me know in the comments or via other means how you motivate yourself and your team. Looking
forward to other views about this topic.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>After the first post in this series &ndash;
<a href="/2013/07/15/a-day-in-my-life-as-an-entrepreneur-the-begining/">The Beginning</a> &ndash;
I was asked to write something about my motivation and how my days look
like. Where should I start&hellip; Do you don&rsquo;t dream about working without breaks 24/7 and have a job
where you don&rsquo;t get money, but you have to pay for it&hellip; Really not!?! Then
maybe the profession of an entrepreneur is not the right choice for
you. At least not in the startup boostrap phase.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But let me explain what my personal motivation is. As described in the last post I have
started with small projects during my
studies. The motivation there was to deepen my knowledge in a practical way.
Pretty fast this attitude has developed further to see how far I can go. In the beginning
it was only about programming software, but after a while I have developed
this further to software engineering and how I can organize
the programming more effective. During this time I have also researched what
is needed for a company formation. This knowledge was really handy this year,
by far not complete, but handy.</p>

<p>And what is the motivation today? Of course the experience that you get and the diversity
of knowledge that is needed is one of the main reasons. You learn nearly each day something new.
But maybe more important is the fun that
it makes to build something from scratch. If something does not work&hellip; You
change it. If you are stuck with something&hellip; You switch temporary to another task
and return later to this challenging issue. Additional the gained experience helps to
overcome harder times. It helps also that our company should have a social
impact. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it is easier to do something good, but it lets you
sleep better and it motivates.</p>

<p>Motivation is essential, but how does my day look like? It is maybe more flexible as the average person&rsquo;s working day.
I work when I am ready
and not when I must, at least not for my company. I try to combine as much as
possible and interconnect tasks. This safes time. Additional I have developed
a feeling when I have to stop working on a task where I am stuck. Experience shows
that if I come back later I find by far faster a solution as working without break
on it. Each software developer experiences sooner or later that he or she
has broken more things than fixed if forced to work on a problem at the wrong time.
This costs in the long term more time as it safes. We all know it deep inside.
What additional helps is that most skills learned in computer science are applicable for
other areas as well. This makes the switch to other areas not as hard as it seams. And
that is crucial for entrepreneurship. You can&rsquo;t say I don&rsquo;t do that, because I am only
a software engineer or a XYZ, or whatever your profession is. If you and your team
don&rsquo;t tackle the challenges who else should!?!</p>

<p>Not convinced yet? I have one last motivation that sounds naive, but that should not scare you too much.
Calculated naivety is a powerful tool.</p>

<p>If everybody thinks that he or she is to stupid, to weak, to unimportant, or whatever to have
an impact and change the world, who the hell dictates your day-to-day life? If you think
about it a company is in our society the perfect mean to have an impact. Also if you fail it
is always better than not to have tried. I take my chance&hellip; What about you?</p>

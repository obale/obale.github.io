    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the first post in this series &ndash;
<a href="http://blog.alex-oberhauser.com/2013/07/15/a-day-in-my-life-as-an-entrepreneur-the-begining/">The Beginning</a> &ndash;
I was asked to write something about my motivation and how my days look
like. Where should I start&hellip; Do you don&rsquo;t dream about working without breaks 24/7 and have a job
where you don&rsquo;t get money, but you have to pay for it&hellip; Really not!?! Then
maybe the profession of an entrepreneur is not the right choice for
you. At least not in the startup boostrap phase.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But let me explain what my personal motivation is. As described in the last post I have
started with small projects during my
studies. The motivation there was to deepen my knowledge in a practical way.
Pretty fast this attitude has developed further to see how far I can go. In the beginning
it was only about programming software, but after a while I have developed
this further to software engineering and how I can organize
the programming more effective. During this time I have also researched what
is needed for a company formation. This knowledge was really handy this year,
by far not complete, but handy.</p>

<p>And what is the motivation today? Of course the experience that you get and the diversity
of knowledge that is needed is one of the main reasons. You learn nearly each day something new.
But maybe more important is the fun that
it makes to build something from scratch. If something does not work&hellip; You
change it. If you are stuck with something&hellip; You switch temporary to another task
and return later to this challenging issue. Additional the gained experience helps to
overcome harder times. It helps also that our company should have a social
impact. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it is easier to do something good, but it lets you
sleep better and it motivates.</p>

<p>Motivation is essential, but how does my day look like? It is maybe more flexible as the average person&rsquo;s working day.
I work when I am ready
and not when I must, at least not for my company. I try to combine as much as
possible and interconnect tasks. This safes time. Additional I have developed
a feeling when I have to stop working on a task where I am stuck. Experience shows
that if I come back later I find by far faster a solution as working without break
on it. Each software developer experiences sooner or later that he or she
has broken more things than fixed if forced to work on a problem at the wrong time.
This costs in the long term more time as it safes. We all know it deep inside.
What additional helps is that most skills learned in computer science are applicable for
other areas as well. This makes the switch to other areas not as hard as it seams. And
that is crucial for entrepreneurship. You can&rsquo;t say I don&rsquo;t do that, because I am only
a software engineer or a XYZ, or whatever your profession is. If you and your team
don&rsquo;t tackle the challenges who else should!?!</p>

<p>Not convinced yet? I have one last motivation that sounds naive, but that should not scare you too much.
Calculated naivety is a powerful tool.</p>

<p>If everybody thinks that he or she is to stupid, to weak, to unimportant, or whatever to have
an impact and change the world, who the hell dictates your day-to-day life? If you think
about it a company is in our society the perfect mean to have an impact. Also if you fail it
is always better than not to have tried. I take my chance&hellip; What about you?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post in the series
<a href="http://blog.alex-oberhauser.com/categories/day-in-my-life-as-entrepreneur/">A day in my life as an entrepreneur</a>.
In this series I will share my experience how it feels to be an entrepreneur and what challenges
we face in our day-to-day work. This is basically the story of my company
<a href="http://www.sigimera.com">Sigimera Ltd</a>. and how we survive outside the
big startup hubs. Although we profit from the current
startup hype around the world we are currently not directly part of it. But lets start from
the beginning a few years ago&hellip;</p>

<!--more -->


<p>All started 5 years ago during a dark and stormy winter night in an even darker cellar&hellip; No,
just kidding! The time span ago is approximately true, although it is always hard to say, because you don&rsquo;t
wake up and say: &ldquo;Today I start my new life as entrepreneur!&rdquo;. The rest is made up. Not all stereotypes are true.
Nevertheless&hellip; Around this time I have started my first smaller projects and a short time period after, it was
clear that I want to start my own company, in order to professionally support this projects. I should
mention that I have a background in business and studied at that time computer science at the University of Innsbruck.
This is a powerful combination that helps, but is not needed, so don&rsquo;t be afraid.
During this time I have exploited different technologies and switched pretty often between projects. The
time was not right for the one big project to rule them all.
This was the first phase were I have learned my craft and invested a lot of time to get the basic right and this
approach has never changed. Never stop learning!!!
Additional it was useful that I owned the domain <a href="http://networld.to">networld.to</a> and one server.
With this basic infrastructure I was able to setup a first working environment used for the software
development and get a feeling about workflows and what works and what doesn&rsquo;t for our team.</p>

<p>Now that I have bored you enough let me know in the comments what you expect from such a series of blog post.
Should I continue in chronologically order? Or should I move to the present and write from time to time
flashbacks? Do you want know something special? Every feedback is really appreciated.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.alex-oberhauser.com/2013/07/12/first-post/"/>

    <id>http://blog.alex-oberhauser.com/2013/07/12/first-post</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The short answer is <em>no</em>. The long answer is, it depends&hellip; For example if I
want to write some non-technical articles that are easier to read&hellip; or if I
want to share with you my experience as entrepreneur&hellip; And by the way since
when do I need a license for a blog!?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The Networld blog (see <a href="http://blog.networld.to">http://blog.networld.to</a>) is only from time to time active.
Nevertheless I have decided to setup this blog in order to be more visible and
don&rsquo;t hide behind a meta-project. It gives me also the possibility to write
about stuff that is not directly related to Networld or one of the
sub-projects. But don&rsquo;t expect too much. I am not going to write about my private
life &ndash; who the hell cares anyway!?! Except of the three letter services of course.</p>

<p>On the other side I will give you information about the current efforts that
are related to my company Sigimera Ltd., but that don&rsquo;t fit into any other
channel. Other than that I have absolutely no clue what to write here. Maybe
I will tell you also about my motivation and how I overcome the
difficulties that are for free in a startup.</p>

<p>And at the end the full truth why this blog exists&hellip; Octopress running on
github.io is fun to use. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
